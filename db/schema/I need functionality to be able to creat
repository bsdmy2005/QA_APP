I need functionality to be able to create an API key under admin. In addition, the admin currently is all over the place. There's multiple admin actions, but they're not laid out together. So can you create a sidebar navigation template followed by pages for the different admin actions I perform? That is mapping of both users, defining of admin API keys, as well as the current functionality that I have where I create categories, tags, etc.
